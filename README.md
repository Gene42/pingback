## Pingback ElasticSearch Configuration 

### Development

To quickly set up a running ES instance, make sure you have docker and
docker-compose install. Then run `docker-compose up` in this directory.

ElasticSearch should be running on http://localhost:9200/ and you can view the
Kibana GUI at http://localhost:5601/

If you are on Windows, instead install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
You may have to restart your machine if you didn't previously have Virtualbox.
After installing Vagrant, do the following (it may take a while):
```sh
vagrant up
```

### Production

- Install `./elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` as the config file for your ES instance.
- Install
  [elasticsearch-readonlyrest-plugin](https://github.com/sscarduzio/elasticsearch-readonlyrest-plugin)
- It is recommended to use an ES interface like
  [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) to browse and graph the ES
  indeces. **Note** if Kibana is not running on the same machine as ES, make
  sure to allow it's IP in the `readonlyrest` section of `elasticsearch.yml`

#### Tips

- Peruse the [ElasticSearch API Doc](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.2/index.html). 
  It'll be of use if you need to modify any of the indeces.
- Since the data-model allows multiple pings for a single client to be
  recorded, you have to be careful to exclude the old pings from your
  aggregate queries and graphs. A simple way to check pings over the last
  three days is to search `timestamp[-3d to *]`.
